<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>On 22 August 1485 the battle of Bosworth provided
its victor with the throne of England. Richard III
died sword in hand and was unceremoniously
buried in the Grey Friars at Leicester, and on that same
day the victor, Henry Tudor, was as simply crowned and
acclaimed by his troops as Henry VII. So began the Tudor
dynasty in England which was to last until the death of
Elizabeth in 1603, to be one of the most colourful periods
of English history and to witness the arrival of the Renaissance
in England. Later than its manifestation on the
Continent, but thereby reaping the benefits of continental
developments, English humanism as a result was soon to
become no mean rival. The development of English literature
is too well known for comment, while classical studies,
and especially those in Greek, were to rival their continental
counterpart by the end of the first quarter of the sixteenth
century. Science, however, and more particularly
medicine, were laggards.</p>
<p>In those closing years of the fifteenth century which
ushered in the new Tudor monarchy the art of healing
derived from two sources, the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge and the organizations of barbers and surgeons.
At Oxford medical teaching was organized by the fifteenth
century, and medicine constituted one of the four faculties
of the university together with theology, law, and arts. Yet
at Oxford, as at Cambridge, the medical curriculum was
long to remain medieval.<a class="fn" id="fri_1" href="#fni_1">[1]</a> Both schools had taken their
model from Paris, but whereas Parisian medicine had
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
begun to stir and advance in the fifteenth century, the
English universities remained somnolent. At Cambridge
the degree of Doctor of Medicine required altogether
twelve years of study based upon lectures and discussions
drawn from medieval sources. While it is true that two
years of this time were to be spent in the practice of medicine&mdash;seemingly
a borrowing from the methods of Montpellier&mdash;there
was no provision for human anatomical study,<a class="fn" id="fri_2" href="#fni_2">[2]</a>
although this was recognized and demonstrated with some
slight annual regularity to the Parisian students from the
latter fifteenth century onward.</p>
<p>If we turn to the other source of healing, the organizations
of the barbers and the surgeons, in so far as anatomy
was concerned the situation was no better and, indeed, it
may be said to have been worse in view of the obvious
relationship which ought to have obtained between surgery
and anatomy. In London the fraternity of barbers existed as
early as 1308,<a class="fn" id="fri_3" href="#fni_3">[3]</a> and the craft of surgery as a body distinct
from that of the barbers is recorded in 1368.<a class="fn" id="fri_4" href="#fni_4">[4]</a> Both barbers
and surgeons sought to establish rules of professional conduct
for the members of their respective organizations as
well as a period of time and a curriculum to be satisfied by
aspirants to barbery or to surgery. Despite the efforts of the
surgeons to control the practice of surgery, relegating to
the barbers only the most simple and menial tasks, certain
of the more ambitious barbers sought to go beyond such
activities as beard-trimming, cutting, and phlebotomy,
and this determination gave rise in the first quarter of the
fifteenth century to the barber-surgeon[, no longer acting in
the normal occupation of the barber and clearly divorced
from his old trade.<a class="fn" id="fri_5" href="#fni_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Throughout the fifteenth century the barber-surgeons and
surgeons appear to have remained on fairly amicable terms,
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
presumably carrying on much the same sort of practice.
The surgeons, who took precedence on occasions of solemnities
and festivities, were perhaps somewhat better trained,
but nowhere is there any record that such training required
the study of human anatomy.<a class="fn" id="fri_6" href="#fni_6">[6]</a> One learned the trade by
apprenticeship to a surgeon and by consulting textbooks of
surgery. From surviving manuscripts it is possible to determine
what these textual guides were: primarily such as
those of the celebrated fourteenth-century surgeons, Gui de
Chauliac and Henri de Mondeville. It is true that late
medieval surgeons were accustomed to introduce the surgical
subject by a short anatomical preface, medieval in character,
the result of cursory and incomplete post-mortem examinations,
but hardly sufficient to permit a proper grasp of
anatomy even were that possible of attainment from literary
sources.</p>
<p>Hence the opening of the Tudor dynasty in England
witnessed a medicine and a surgery lacking the essential
and fundamental knowledge of the human structure. The
traditions of English medicine were medieval, and medieval
medicine had not concerned itself especially with
anatomy. If we compare continental medicine of the same
period the situation is found to be considerably different. In
the course of the fifteenth century anatomy was being practised&mdash;diffidently
to be sure, but nevertheless recognized and
employed in Paris where the first human dissection, in the
form of a brief autopsy, had been performed in 1407.<a class="fn" id="fri_7" href="#fni_7">[7]</a> The
first human anatomy mentioned in the <i>Commentaries</i> of
the Medical Faculty of Paris was performed in 1477-8 on
the body of an executed criminal,<a class="fn" id="fri_8" href="#fni_8">[8]</a> but the incident is recorded
without any suggestion of its being a novelty and so
raises the possibility that there may have been other dissections
in previous years. The practice of human anatomy
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
was even earlier in Italy where there is record of an autopsy
in 1286,<a class="fn" id="fri_9" href="#fni_9">[9]</a> and in 1316 Mundinus, called the &lsquo;Restorer of
Anatomy&rsquo;, completed his <i>Anothomia</i> in which he describes
his systematic dissection of the human body.
Official decree permitted the practice of human dissection
in many cities, especially those with medical schools, and
such official recognition was granted at Bologna in 1405<a class="fn" id="fri_10" href="#fni_10">[10]</a>
and at Padua in 1429.<a class="fn" id="fri_11" href="#fni_11">[11]</a> Elsewhere similar recognition of
human dissection was obtained at Montpellier in 1340,<a class="fn" id="fri_12" href="#fni_12">[12]</a> at
Lerida in 1391,<a class="fn" id="fri_13" href="#fni_13">[13]</a> at Vienna in 1435,<a class="fn" id="fri_14" href="#fni_14">[14]</a> and at T&uuml;bingen in
1485.<a class="fn" id="fri_15" href="#fni_15">[15]</a> As a consequence, by the opening of the sixteenth
century a series of anatomical texts, based in varying degrees
upon human dissection, began to appear, such as those of
Benedetti, Achillini, and Berengario da Carpi.</p>
<p>The difference can be explained, at least in part, by the
fact that on the Continent the classical revival of the Renaissance
had caused or was causing medieval tradition to be
replaced by that of classical antiquity. The Renaissance
represented an effort to revive the spirit and interests of the
classical world, and classical antiquity had been much interested
in the structure of man. Especially important was
the recovery of the Greek language and literature since it
made possible the recovery of the writings of the great
classical physicians, notably Hippocrates and Galen, for
generally speaking classical Greece had shown more interest
in human anatomy than had classical Rome. This recovery
had occurred first in Italy, then moved northward
across the Alps and only in the early sixteenth century did
it reach England.</p>
<p>While even earlier some Englishmen had travelled to
Italy to study the classical revival at its source, and even to
study the more advanced Italian medicine of Padua, it may
be said that Thomas Grocyn was the first significant leader
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
of the new classical movement in England, in particular
the recovery of Greek. He had managed to learn some
Greek even in England, but it was not until after a trip to
Italy in 1488, where he spent two years, that he returned
to instil Oxford with an enthusiasm for classical Greek
humanism.<a class="fn" id="fri_16" href="#fni_16">[16]</a> But if Grocyn is of importance as an English
pioneer in the recovery of Greek and Hellenic studies, of
far greater importance for the present subject was Grocyn&rsquo;s
lifelong friend and ultimately the executor of his estate,
Thomas Linacre.</p>
<p>Linacre looms very large in the revival of classical medicine
which gave a general impetus toward a better and
more modern medicine. Born at Canterbury about 1460 he
was led ultimately by his studies to Oxford where he became
a fellow of All Souls College in 1484.<a class="fn" id="fri_17" href="#fni_17">[17]</a> Although by
this time he could make some beginnings of the study of
the revived classical literature, and even Greek, at Oxford,
nevertheless it was still desirable if possible to pursue such
studies in Italy, and with the opportunity offered him,
Linacre travelled to that land about 1487, remaining at
least until 1496,<a class="fn" id="fri_18" href="#fni_18">[18]</a> in which latter year he received the degree
of Doctor of Medicine from the University of Padua.<a class="fn" id="fri_19" href="#fni_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Returned to England, Linacre taught Greek at Oxford.
Grocyn was his friend, Sir Thomas More his pupil, and
upon the arrival at Oxford of Erasmus, that great classical
scholar likewise became an intimate, all of them enthusiasts
and promoters of Greek studies.</p>
<p>However, as a physician Linacre had a special bent toward
the Greek medical classics. This was manifested by
the appearance in 1517 of his translation of Galen&rsquo;s book
<i>On Hygiene</i>. In 1519 this was followed by the <i>Method of
Treatment</i>, in 1521 by the book <i>On Temperaments</i>, and two
years later by the <i>Natural Faculties</i> and <i>On the Use of Pulses</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
In 1524 just after Linacre&rsquo;s death a sixth translation, that of
Galen&rsquo;s <i>Differences of Symptoms</i> and <i>Causes of Symptoms</i>,
appeared. As yet very few physicians in England knew
Greek, but they all knew Latin, and these accurate translations
into clear, straightforward Latin made a considerable
portion of Galen&rsquo;s medical writings available for the first
time. The contrast between medieval medical writings and
those of Galen which had now been made available
seemed to emphasize that general Renaissance belief that
civilization had reached its peak in classical times and that
much could be gained by a return to classical teachings, in
this instance the teaching of classical physicians. It is true
that only the Galenic books on medicine had been translated,
but they were sufficient to whet the appetite for more,
and as the new generation of physicians arose, now trained
in Greek, if the pattern were followed, they would turn to
the Galenic writings on anatomy in the original language
as well as to those of Hippocrates.<a class="fn" id="fri_20" href="#fni_20">[20]</a> The first of this younger
generation who is recorded to have come under this Greek
medical influence and made this possibility a reality produced
two remarkable pioneer efforts: the first recorded dissection
of a human body in England about 1531 and the
first book on anatomy written in England, published in
1532, or, reckoned according to the Gregorian calendar,
1533.</p>
<p>The person responsible for these two milestones was
named David Edwardes, or, in the Latin form he employed,
Edguardus. However, very little is known of his life and
activities. He was admitted as a scholar to Corpus Christi
College, Oxford, on 9 August 1517, and the register of
admissions indicates that he was then fifteen years old and
a native of Northamptonshire.<a class="fn" id="fri_21" href="#fni_21">[21]</a> He became Bachelor of
Arts in 1522<a class="fn" id="fri_22" href="#fni_22">[22]</a> although for a time previous to this, in 1521,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
he appears briefly to have held the readership in Greek,
substituting for the regular reader, Edward Wotton, then
abroad.<a class="fn" id="fri_23" href="#fni_23">[23]</a> In 1525 Edwardes became Master of Arts,<a class="fn" id="fri_24" href="#fni_24">[24]</a> and
thereafter received a fellowship in the college. He is further
mentioned in the account book of the college for 1527-8 as
receiving 38<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>,<a class="fn" id="fri_25" href="#fni_25">[25]</a> presumably for further teaching of Greek.</p>
<p>Corpus Christi College had been founded in 1515-16
chiefly through the magnanimity of Richard Foxe, Bishop
of Winchester, and was provided with its statutes in 1517.
The founder, strongly interested in the newly revived
classical learning had provided for a chair of Greek, which,
as has been mentioned, was briefly held by Edwardes in an
interim capacity, while the first president of the college,
John Claymond, was likewise a strong advocate of the new
learning.</p>
<p>Perhaps not sufficient stress has been placed upon the
contribution made by physicians, at least in England, to
the revival of Greek studies, although it is sometimes difficult
to determine which of the two disciplines, medicine or
Greek, was the impulsion to the study of the other. Both
Linacre and Wotton were serious students of Greek before
they undertook medical studies, but once embarked upon
medicine, both of them having studied at Padua, not only
did they become especially conscious of the failings of
medieval medicine in contrast to the classical, but the
philosophical and literary aspects of Galen&rsquo;s writings must
have caused them to retain a concern with Greek literature
as a whole even though their primary consideration had
come to be a single facet of the body of that literature.
Furthermore, the scientific nature of their interest permitted
no equivocation in their knowledge of the language. Translations
of Galen or Hippocrates required an exactitude
beyond that of purely literary treatises. But whatever the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
relevancy of such remarks, it is certainly of significance that
among the first teachers of Greek in England were Linacre,
Clement, and Wotton, all physicians, and for our present
purpose as it relates to David Edwardes, it should be noted
that two of these men, Clement and Wotton, were
associated with Corpus Christi College.</p>
<p>In addition to the stress upon Greek studies which must
inevitably have led Edwardes to the classical Greek writers
upon medicine and conducted him along the pathway
already marked out by Thomas Linacre, there were in the
college certain possibly more direct influences towards an
interest in medicine which have already been alluded to. In
short, John Clement, the early lecturer of Greek<a class="fn" id="fri_26" href="#fni_26">[26]</a> was a
physician and friend of Linacre as well as a fellow in the
College of Physicians of London which Linacre had inaugurated
in 1518, while still another student of medicine
was Edward Wotton, Reader in Greek and later physician
to Henry VIII, for whom Edwardes had briefly substituted.</p>
<p>Still another incentive toward medical study may have
been a requirement in chapter 25 of the original statutes. In
accordance with this all fellows of the college who held
the degree of Master of Arts were required to assume holy
orders, unless deputed to the study of medicine. It has been
suggested that recipients of this exception were originally
expected to attend to the medical needs of the other inmates
of the college,<a class="fn" id="fri_27" href="#fni_27">[27]</a> and it seems likely that Edwardes was one of
these <i>medicinae deputati</i>.</p>
<p>Our next record indicates that he had removed to the
University of Cambridge where in 1528-9, and upon payment
of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i><a class="fn" id="fri_28" href="#fni_28">[28]</a> and after lecturing publicly upon Galen&rsquo;s
<i>De Differentiis Febrium</i>, he was incepted in medicine with
recognition of &lsquo;seven years study of medicine&rsquo;, presumably
at Oxford.<a class="fn" id="fri_29" href="#fni_29">[29]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>In his only known book, to be considered later, Edwardes
informs us that his first practice of medicine had been &lsquo;at
Bristol, having left my teachers only shortly before and
begun to swim without any support&rsquo;,<a class="fn" id="fri_30" href="#fni_30">[30]</a> although it is not
clear whether this represented a brief interlude between
Oxford and Cambridge or after he had received his degree
of Doctor of Medicine. Whatever the case may have been,
the few remaining autobiographical references are to his
practice in and around Cambridge. As a member of
the Faculty of Medicine, it is possible that Edwardes was
criticized for devoting an excessive amount of time to his
private practice, since in 1530-1 permission was granted
him to be excused from a statutory requirement of attendance
at &lsquo;all congregations, masses and exequies&rsquo;.<a class="fn" id="fri_31" href="#fni_31">[31]</a> Nevertheless
he participated in the examinations of at least two
students, one in 1537-8<a class="fn" id="fri_32" href="#fni_32">[32]</a> and the other in 1540-1.<a class="fn" id="fri_33" href="#fni_33">[33]</a></p>
<p>Edwardes&rsquo;s little book, to which reference was made
above, was published in London in 1532 [O.S.] by Robert
Redman. It is composed of two treatises of which the first,
entitled <i>On Symptoms and Prognostications</i> (<i>De Indiciis et
Praecognitionibus</i>), deals with uroscopy and medical prognostication,
and since it represents merely the continuation
of a medieval tradition it is of little importance except, as
has been said, for its few autobiographical details. In his
practice of medicine Edwardes appears to have represented,
as we might expect, a combination of the old and the new.
While giving support to uroscopy and displaying some
sympathy toward folk medicine, he also gave allegiance to
Hippocrates and Galen, and like his continental colleagues
of this period he was not averse to the introduction of a
word or even several lines of Greek into his text, so indicating
his enthusiasm for and his ties with the classical revival.
Furthermore, he was certainly one of the first English
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
physicians to appreciate Linacre and terms him &lsquo;the most
learned physician of his age&rsquo;.<a class="fn" id="fri_34" href="#fni_34">[34]</a></p>
<p>The second treatise, <i>A Brief but Excellent Introduction to
Anatomy</i> (<i>In Anatomicen Introductio Luculenta et Brevis</i>), is, as
has been mentioned, the first work published in England
which was devoted solely to anatomy, and therefore despite
its brevity it deserves some consideration in the general
history of medicine and even greater consideration in that
of English medicine. Turning our attention now to this
treatise on anatomy it should be first noted that although
printed in the same volume with the work on medical
symptoms and sharing a common title-page with that
work, the treatise on anatomy has a separate dedication to
Henry Howard (1517?-1547), Earl of Surrey. It had been
at the request of Henry VIII that this young nobleman took
up residence at Windsor and lived there from 1530 to 1532
as the companion of Henry&rsquo;s son, the Duke of Richmond.
Since Edwardes had dedicated the first treatise to the Duke
of Richmond on 21 December 1532, it is not difficult to
comprehend his choice of the duke&rsquo;s companion for the
second dedication which bears the date 1 January 1532, or,
according to the Gregorian calendar, 1533. There is nothing
remarkable about this latter dedication, which contains
the usual flattery, except for the final passage. There
the author remarked upon the ignorance of anatomy among
physicians, sometimes with lethal results. He recognized
that the subject of anatomy was a difficult one, hence his
treatise has been written with brevity and clarity. Later, as
he promised, if opportunity were to be granted to him he
would write a more elaborate work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hereafter, if God permit, I shall compose a complete book
of anatomy in which I shall further the opinions of all the
learned, to which my own opinion will be added. I could have
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
done this at present but not, however, with the same effort or
with the form of an introduction preserved. It remains that this
little book, which we have enlisted in the service of the commonwealth,
may be pleasing to you, for it recognizes the existence
of those very few unlearned physicians by whose mistakes
many perish, from which this fact will be gathered, that no
parts of the body should be unknown to physicians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This promise of a more extensive work in which the author
was to include his independent anatomical observations,
presumably based on further human dissection, appears not
to have been fulfilled or, at any rate, there is no record of
any such later and more extended anatomical treatise by
Edwardes.</p>
<p>The text of this <i>Introduction to Anatomy</i> fills no more than
fifteen small pages, and its very brevity must have made it
virtually useless; even the author says that it &lsquo;is indeed a
slight work&rsquo;. The plan of presentation is that which had
been popularized by Mundinus and was required by the
relative speeds with which the different parts of the body
succumbed to putrefaction during the course of dissection.
Thus Edwardes first describes the lower venter, that is, the
abdomen, abdominal cavity, and pelvis, next the thorax,
and finally the brain and nervous system. Within his very
brief presentation no mention is made of the extremities
while, relative to the limits of the discussion, a preponderance
of attention has been devoted to what were considered
the organs of nutrition and blood manufacture.</p>
<p>The anatomical nomenclature is mildly astonishing,
especially when one considers the time and place of composition.
But if one considers that Edwardes was sufficiently
learned in Greek to act as Reader in Greek at his college for
a short period, it will not be too amazing to find him somewhat
scornful of the terms employed by those he calls
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
&lsquo;Barbarians&rsquo;, that is, the European school influenced by Moslem
medical writers, chiefly through the <i>Canon</i> of Avicenna,
which employed an anatomical terminology drawn from
Latin and from curious hybrid forms partly Latin, partly
Greek, partly Arabic and in some parts from Hebrew.
Edwardes, on the contrary, employs classical Greek terminology
as, for example, omentum rather than the medieval <i>zirbus</i>
and mesenteric in preference to <i>meseraic</i>. In so far as his
description extends, his nomenclature is as &lsquo;modern&rsquo;, if not
more so, than that of some of the more learned anatomists
on the Continent. Yet, while his vocabulary may be more
modern his anatomy is not. Indeed, in the introduction he
remarked, as has been mentioned, that in the future he
hoped to write a more extensive work &lsquo;to which my own
opinion will be added&rsquo;. By implication, then, in this first
brief treatise he had drawn upon earlier authorities, and
while we might expect that this student of Greek would
turn to Galen and Hippocrates this is true only in part. The
liver as he describes it is medieval, the three-chambered heart
is Aristotelian, derived from those &lsquo;Barbarians&rsquo; he scorned.</p>
<p>While the treatise is noteworthy as the first work written
in England solely devoted to anatomy, the text intrinsically
is of little further value except for one statement referring to
the emulgent, or renal veins. &lsquo;In the body of that one whom
we dissected very recently the left branch had a higher place
of origin. Very often, however, the opposite occurs, so that
the right emulgent vein is carried higher in the body.&rsquo; Here
we have the first reference to human dissection in England,
in which, moreover, the anatomist observing through his
own eyes rather than those of past authorities, noted a variation
from the commonly given description of the emulgent
veins, a description derived from Galen&rsquo;s anatomical studies
on animals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Little more can be said about Edwardes. He seems to
have died about 1542,<a class="fn" id="fri_35" href="#fni_35">[35]</a> and perhaps this explains why the
larger work was never to be published. Perhaps, had he
remained at Oxford, he might have established an anatomical
tradition, and so provided the influence which his
book was not to have. Today only one copy of this little
treatise is known, that in the library of the British Museum,
and no consideration appears to have been paid to it from
Edwardes&rsquo;s day to the present. However, its virtual extinction
was not the result of hard usage by students such as that
which determined the almost complete annihilation of
Vesalius&rsquo; <i>Tabulae Anatomicae</i>. As has been said, no contemporary
mentioned Edwardes, despite the fact that his
book was published in London. The edition must have
been a small one, and copies were not likely to have been
preserved as other and better works on anatomy began to be
imported from the Continent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the universities continued their drowsy course
so far unaffected in any way by the efforts of an alumnus of
one of them. The barber-surgeons and surgeons appear to
have been equally unproductive of anything new, still leaning
upon earlier continental writers. Yet a few individuals
recognized the need for improvement. Well before the surgeons
of England received official encouragement for anatomical
study the surgeons of Edinburgh had asked for
and obtained bodies for dissection. On 1 July 1505 the
magistrates of Edinburgh granted a Seal of Cause to the
Guild of Surgeons and Barbers, and this was confirmed by
James IV on 13 October 1506. Among the clauses regulating
the practice of the barbers and the surgeons is one
giving them the body of one felon each year for an anatomy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... and that we may have anis [once] in the yeir ane condampnit
man efter he be deid to mak antomell of, quhairthraw we
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
may haif experience, ilk ane to instrict vtheris ... and that na
barbour, maister nor seruand, within this burgh hantt [practise]
vse nor exerce the craft of Surregenrie without he be expert and
knaw perfytelie the thingis abouewritten.<a class="fn" id="fri_36" href="#fni_36">[36]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edinburgh, therefore, was the cradle of anatomical study in
the British Isles. In England Thomas Linacre had founded
the College of Physicians of London in 1518 with the idea
of its being a select body of physicians to raise medical
standards and maintain them through its power of licensing
to practice. The need of more modern surgical texts was
indicated by the publication in 1525 of a translation of the
work of the late fifteenth-century German surgeon, Hieronymus
Brunschwig, which contained a brief section on
anatomy, but there appears to have been no attempt to produce
a new and up-to-date surgery in England. The fact
was that the more advanced books from continental Europe
proceeded to smother any continuance of independent
native efforts, and in the field of anatomy this makes the
early appearance of David Edwardes&rsquo;s little treatise an
astonishing chronological anomaly in the history of English
anatomical writing. The importance of anatomy was now
to be recognized, but it would be a long time before another
native English treatise on the subject was published.</p>
<p>The introduction of the officially recognized, and even
encouraged, study of human anatomy into England was the
result of influences brought to bear from several sources: the
desire of King Henry VIII to improve the practice of medicine
and surgery in England and possibly, too, with
thoughts for a higher quality of military surgery; and the
desire, as well, of some of the more thoughtful surgeons, of
whom Thomas Vicary was probably one. So it was that
in 1540 the Company of Barbers was united with the
Fraternity of Surgeons to form what was called the United
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Company of Barber-Surgeons of which Thomas Vicary
was named Master in 1541, an event handsomely commemorated
in a painting commissioned from Hans Holbein
the younger.<a class="fn" id="fri_37" href="#fni_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>In the Charter by which the union was officially sanctioned,
a statement is to be found which was to be of
particular importance to the advancement of anatomical
knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the sayd maysters or governours of the mistery and comminaltie
of barbours and surgeons of London, and their successours
yerely for ever after their sad discrecions at their free liberte and
pleasure shal and maie have and take without contradiction
foure persons condempned adiudged and put to deathe for
feloni by the due order of the kynges lawe of thys realme for
anatomies without any further sute or labour to be made to the
kynges highnes his heyres or successours for the same. And to
make incision of the same deade bodies or otherwyse to order
the same after their said discrecions at their pleasures for their
further and better knowlage instruction insight learnyng and
experience in the sayd scyence or facultie of surgery.<a class="fn" id="fri_38" href="#fni_38">[38]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is of interest to note that very soon after the Charter had
been granted, Thomas Vicary approached the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen of London to make sure that the Barber-Surgeons
should receive the bodies of the felons for anatomical
study. It would seem that the Court of Aldermen were
not sure how they should direct their Sheriffs, for the
Minutes of the Court for 14 December 1540 state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Item, Master Laxton &amp; Master Bowes, Shreves of this
Citye, prayed the Advyse of this howse for &amp; concernying the
Delyuerye ouer of one of the dedde bodyes of the Felons of late
condempned to dethe within this Citye, And requyred of the
seyd Master Shreves by Master Vycary &amp; other the surgeons of
this Citye for Annotamye, Accordyng to the fourme of an
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Acte of parlyament thereof lately made. And Agreyd that the
same Acte be first seen &amp; then Master Shreves to work ther
after.<a class="fn" id="fri_39" href="#fni_39">[39]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With human dissection material assured, the United
Company proceeded to appoint a Reader of Anatomy, the
first perhaps being Thomas Vicary, and although the intervening
records of the company are not complete, it is
known that in 1546 Dr. John Caius, lately returned from
Padua, where he had been acquainted with and even lived
for a time with the celebrated anatomist Andreas Vesalius,
was appointed and held the position of Reader of Anatomy
for the next seventeen years. In his brief autobiography
Caius refers to these dissections which he performed &lsquo;for
almost twenty years&rsquo;, and adds, &lsquo;By the wish of the most
illustrious prince Henry VIII, King of England, I performed
them in London before the surgeons; among the
physicians at that time there was no dissection.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fri_40" href="#fni_40">[40]</a> It may be
assumed, however, that by &lsquo;physicians&rsquo; Caius was referring
to those of London rather than to those of the universities.
Nevertheless, his remark helps to explain the lack of anatomical
works which might have competed with those of
the Continent. The physicians, although better trained in
languages than the surgeons and, we may assume, literary
exposition, were as yet not interested in the subject of
anatomy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it does seem somewhat incredible that the
physicians were so late in taking up the practice of human
dissection. While it is always dangerous to exceed the
limits of evidence, this peculiar situation in regard to the
College of Physicians of London requires that attention be
called to a statute of the college reproduced by Munk who
gives it the date 1569-70.<a class="fn" id="fri_41" href="#fni_41">[41]</a> According to this authority, the
terms employed in the statute, reproduced below in translation,

suggest that human anatomical dissection was already
being employed by the physicians of the college at the time,
although it seems impossible to determine whether or not
the reference is to a period earlier than 1565 when Elizabeth
granted them four bodies annually for anatomical purposes.<a class="fn" id="fri_42" href="#fni_42">[42]</a>
However, it seems unlikely that the college, which was so
concerned with the enforcement of laws concerning medicine
would itself perform an illegal action and therefore
that Elizabeth&rsquo;s grant to the college most likely introduced
it to human dissection. Furthermore, one wonders just how
frequently the college employed its new right, and in this
respect it is interesting to note that there is no reference
either to Elizabeth&rsquo;s grant or to any dissection at all in the
<i>Annals</i> of the college as written by John Caius.<a class="fn" id="fri_43" href="#fni_43">[43]</a></p>
<p>Although the study of human anatomy was now officially
recognized and regularly pursued, at least in London,
it would be incorrect to believe that native English anatomical
writings would be forthcoming to continue the course
modestly established by David Edwardes. The apathy or
even hostility of physicians toward anatomical studies was
an obstacle experienced earlier on the Continent and referred
to by Vesalius who contributed no small share to the
growth of anatomy&rsquo;s respectability in the eyes of physicians.
However, the time lag between the Continent and England
had resulted in a disregard of anatomical studies by English
physicians at the very times when continental physicians
had begun to interest themselves in the subject and publish
anatomical studies. As a result it was inevitable that for
such Englishmen as were interested in anatomy it was easier
to import the more advanced and elaborate continental
texts, and dependence on such alien works was for long to
be the regular pattern. But even with these advanced, contemporary
works available, the practice continued among
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
the surgeons of republishing old and obsolete anatomico-surgical
treatises of late medieval times. If such a practice
was dictated by an elementary knowledge, certainly the
continuance of it would not lead to any development.</p>
<p>In 1544 a Flemish engraver named Thomas Lambrit,
better known under his pseudonym of Geminus, engraved
on copper a series of anatomical figures plagiarized from
the <i>Fabrica</i> and <i>Epitome</i> of Vesalius. Geminus displayed the
plates, which are of considerable artistic merit, indeed,
the first of high quality to be produced in England, to King
Henry VIII. That monarch, aware of the need of anatomical
books to bolster the anatomical teaching now in progress,
urged Geminus to publish his engravings. Never one
to scorn the chance of gain, Geminus proceeded to follow
this royal advice in the succeeding year (1545) and added
to his plates a dedication to the king and the text of
Vesalius&rsquo; <i>Epitome</i>.<a class="fn" id="fri_44" href="#fni_44">[44]</a> For some peculiar reason the completely
innocent John Caius has occasionally been blamed as the
impetus to this plagiarized publication despite the fact that
Geminus states plainly in his preface that Henry VIII was
responsible for his decision to publish.</p>
<p>While the illustrations plagiarized from Vesalius may
have been of some pedagogical value, the text of the
<i>Epitome</i> certainly was no anatomical manual, and the fact
that it was in Latin, which many if not most of the surgeons
could not read, gave it even less value.</p>
<p>It was perhaps at least partly for these reasons that
Thomas Vicary appears to have issued in 1548 an anatomical
text in English entitled <i>A Profitable Treatise of the Anatomie
of Mans Body</i>. No copy of it is known to exist today,
and its existence is realized only through mention of it on
the title-page of an edition published in 1577 by the surgeons
of St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital and a reference to it in
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
1565 by another surgeon, John Halle, who refers to Vicary
as &lsquo;the firste that euer wrote a treatyse of Anatomye in
English (to the profite of his brethren chirurgiens and the
helpe of younge studientes) as farre as I can learne&rsquo;.<a class="fn" id="fri_45" href="#fni_45">[45]</a>
However, to refer to the &lsquo;profite&rsquo; and &lsquo;helpe&rsquo; to be obtained
from Vicary&rsquo;s treatise is to reveal the deplorable
state of anatomical studies in England at the time and to
cause one to wonder if Halle had read by way of contrast
the continental writings of that period. It seems very likely
that what has been termed Vicary&rsquo;s anatomy was nothing
other than a copy of a manuscript, presently in the Wellcome
Historical Medical Library in London, dated 1392
and merely a compilation of Lanfranc, Henri de Mondeville,
and Gui de Chauliac, the most recent of them dead
in 1367. Thus not only was Vicary&rsquo;s work not based upon
dissection, except for a secondhand account of crude fourteenth-century
autopsy, but it represented a definite case of
retrogression.</p>
<p>The next anatomical publication in England was a new
edition in 1553 of Geminus&rsquo;s plagiarized anatomical plates,
but this time with an English text by Nicholas Udall, best
known as the author of the first important English comedy,
<i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>, and utterly lacking in knowledge
of anatomy. In consequence one may correctly hazard that
this work, published with commercial rather than pedagogical
motives, would not contribute much to knowledge
of anatomy in England, even though the text was
now in English. It is true that Vesalius&rsquo; descriptions of his
illustrations were put into English, the first translation into
English of any portion of the <i>Fabrica</i>, but the text which
now replaced the <i>Epitome</i> of the earlier edition of 1545, like
Vicary&rsquo;s work, is predominantly indebted to that same
fourteenth-century manuscript compiled from the writings
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
of late medieval surgeons. Finally, the sheets of this work
were reissued in 1559 with a new preface written by Richard
Eden which aimed to delude the public into the belief
that the publication had been revised.</p>
<p>About this time, too, a small series of anatomical fugitive
sheets with superimposed flaps made their appearance
in England. One, at least, had two leaves of English text to
explain the woodcut and is nearly always discovered bound
into the 1559 reissue of Geminus&rsquo;s book. The fugitive
sheets, like their continental predecessors and followers,
added very little to anatomical knowledge and must have
been for popular consumption.</p>
<p>If we turn now for a moment to give consideration to
continental activity during the same period, there is no
difficulty in observing the superiority of publications
abroad. In 1543 the <i>Fabrica</i> of Vesalius was published, in
1545 the <i>De Dissectione</i> of Rivi&egrave;re and Estienne, in 1555 the
revised and much improved second edition of the <i>Fabrica</i>,
in 1556 <i>Composicion del Cuerpo Humano</i> of Valverde, and in
1559 the <i>De Re Anatomica</i> of Colombo. It is little wonder
that these foreign texts overwhelmed the English market
and prevented any initiative which might have led to the
publication of any but the most rudimentary manuals, presuming
that there was in England anyone who had pursued
the study of anatomy sufficiently to be in a position
to compete with the continental authorities. On the other
hand, the superiority of the foreign publications owed part
of that superiority to the fact that they were the work of
much better educated physicians who had undertaken the
study of anatomy, whereas in England the subject was yet
very largely under the control of the less learned and less
articulate surgeons who thought of anatomy more as a
limited body of technical information required for surgery
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
rather than a field of knowledge to be studied for itself and
capable of indefinite expansion. David Edwardes had sought
to set medicine on the right course, but to no avail. While in
time the Faculties of Medicine in the two universities would
pay some lip-service to anatomy, yet some considerable time
was to pass before they became genuinely interested in the
subject.</p>
<p>In 1549 a royal examination of the Oxford statutes led
to a declaration that they were &lsquo;antiquated, semi-barbarous
and obscure&rsquo;, and new ones were substituted. In regard to
medicine it was declared that before receiving the degree of
Bachelor of Medicine the student must see two anatomical
dissections, and himself perform two dissections before receiving
his licence to practice. Before receiving the degree
of Doctor of Medicine he was required to observe two or
three more dissections.<a class="fn" id="fri_46" href="#fni_46">[46]</a> This, however, seems more likely
to have been the ideal than the reality and echoes a similar
but normally unfulfilled requirement in fifteenth-century
Paris. It is more likely that the frequency with which anatomy
was conducted at Oxford would have depended upon
the particular interest of the Professor of Medicine, such as
Walter Bayley (1529-93) who became Regius Professor of
Medicine in 1561 and who at his death left his &lsquo;skeleton of
bones in Oxford&rsquo; to his successor in the chair.<a class="fn" id="fri_47" href="#fni_47">[47]</a> However,
no Reader in Anatomy was appointed at Oxford until
1624. Indeed, the founder of the readership, Richard Tomlins,
recognized the situation in his grant by noting that the
study of anatomy was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>more particularly necessary for the faculties and Artes of
Phisicke and Chirurgery, the perfection whereof doth much
avayle to the safety health and comfort of the whole Commonwealth
in the conservation of theire persons: And that there is
as yet in neither of the Vniversities of this Kingdome (thoughe
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
otherwise the most florisshing of the whole Christian world)
any such Anatomy Lecture founded or established.<a class="fn" id="fri_48" href="#fni_48">[48]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we may believe John Caius, writing after the middle of
the century, the first early enthusiasm for Greek studies had
worn off among physicians. Caius, himself a very competent
Grecist, wrote in advocacy of the study of Greek
medicine in the Greek language, that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as each is more capable in his own tongue so he is consistent and
always remains himself which contributes much to clarity, since
each tongue has its own idioms and inexpressible terms which
when translated do not retain the same emphasis or a like grace.
In short, translators some times do not understand certain
things, elsewhere they fall asleep, do not retain exactness of
diction, restrain freedom, and since we are all human and so
desirous of variety, from time to time they slip so that not only
may there be obscurity but even ambiguity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, wrote Caius, in his day &lsquo;everyone turns to the
Latin editions and no one touches the Greek&rsquo;.<a class="fn" id="fri_49" href="#fni_49">[49]</a></p>
<p>It is certainly true that after that first generation of men
like Linacre, there was little interest in England in the
original language of Galen and Hippocrates. The surgeons,
certainly, knew no Greek, and the physicians were not
interested in anatomy. There was to be little controversy,
therefore, as to the meaning of any of Galen&rsquo;s anatomical
terms and less likelihood of investigating and disputing
Galenic assertions. Acceptance without demur of the
translation was a long step toward unquestioned acceptance
of the content of the original. Hence it appears that by the
middle of the sixteenth century the authority of Galen in
Latin dress, or of his commentators, was not very likely to
be opposed. On the Continent it had been instances of
questions and opposition which had brought about anatomical
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
advancement by resort to the only arbiter of doubts
and questions, that is, the cadaver.</p>
<p>With conditions as they have been portrayed it is no
wonder, therefore, that little initiative was displayed in
England. The most popular of the foreign works in England,
as on the Continent, appears to have been the <i>De Re
Anatomica</i> of Colombo which held its position until well
after the opening of the seventeenth century. It was excellent
for its time, not certainly the equal of the <i>Fabrica</i>, but on the
other hand much cheaper to purchase, less bulky to hold,
and not so detailed as to be confusing. It was probably this
particular work in its several editions which more than any
other prevented the appearance of a native English anatomical
text.</p>
<p>In 1578 John Banister published a book entitled <i>The
Historie of Man, sucked from the Sappe of the most approued
Anathomistes</i>. The title indicates the character of the work,
drawn from continental authorities, and especially from
Colombo, despite the fact that Banister was Reader in Anatomy
to the United Company and therefore in a position to
undertake independent researches. Indeed, a contemporary
painting shows Banister in his capacity as Reader standing
beside an open copy of Colombo&rsquo;s <i>De Re Anatomica</i>.<a class="fn" id="fri_50" href="#fni_50">[50]</a></p>
<p>It is clearly apparent that English anatomy in the Tudor
period remained far behind that of the Continent, at least
on the basis of such books as were published in England,
and thereby renders that modest but early effort of David
Edwardes all the more curious.</p>
<p>Edwardes, it must be recalled, had presented his brief
treatise in the same form which was being employed on the
Continent, and we may assume that it represented his
method. What he did was to ignore medieval writers and
return directly to Galen, the supreme authority of that age,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
the &lsquo;Prince of Physicians&rsquo;. Coupled with this, he had begun
to dissect, first, it may be assumed, for better comprehension
of Galen but ultimately by Edwardes or his successors,
discrepancies between the text of Galen and the observed
anatomy would at once have indicated the classic error and
the path to knowledge. Such was the course of continental
development, but English anatomy of the period was faced
by an insurmountable obstacle.</p>
<p>Whereas the medical faculties of continental universities
came to accept anatomy, such was not to be the case with
English medicine until well into the seventeenth century.
As a result, anatomy was not an end in itself but rather a
limited field of knowledge learned in so far as it might be
usefully applied in surgery.</p>
<p>There were, of course, some Englishmen whose training
and knowledge were superior to the quality demonstrated
in English texts, men who had had Paduan training such
as Caius and Harvey. But even Caius remained a Galenist
when continental anatomy had become Vesalian, and
Harvey, despite his thoroughly scientific attitude in respect
to physiology, remained very conservative in his approach
to purely anatomical problems, seeking authority not only
in Galen but in the even more ancient Aristotle.</p>
<p>Under these conditions it seems remarkable that such
great contributions were made to physiology in seventeenth-century
England. The contributions of Harvey, Boyle,
Hooke, and Lower form an amazing contrast to the static
and even retrograde position of anatomy in the preceding
century. In 1565 John Halle, a distinguished surgeon, published
his <i>Anatomy or Dissection of the Body of Man</i> which
was largely a translation of the surgery of Guido Lanfranc
who died in 1315, yet fifty-one years later Harvey had
arrived at the circulation of the blood.<a class="fn" id="fri_51" href="#fni_51">[51]</a></p>

MS., <i>On College Affairs</i>, pp. 55-56: &lsquo;Among our elders the Anatomical
Lecture was considered of such importance that according to everyone&rsquo;s
recollection very few Fellows sought to be excused from that duty except
for very grave reasons. However, lest it happen that frequent dispensations
of that sort should become usual and customary and thence, so it was
feared, lest such a useful institution should gradually perish, they decided
to prevent it through the statutes, by slight penalties in the beginning and
afterward increased and more severe according to the danger. We desiring
to follow their prudent regulation, lest hereafter we admit Fellows into the
Society influenced by a like hope of always declining this duty and not
giving their attention seriously to that task: We establish and Order that
for those refusing the duty of the ordinary anatomical lecture and wishing
to be released wholly from that duty, the penalty of paying the College
twenty pounds, unless because of very serious obstacles approved by the
President and a majority of the Fellows in plenary session. In cases of
lesser importance in which there is not sought a continuing exemption
but a deferment from lecturing for a time, we leave to the judgment of the
President how far this ought to be granted to the applicants; but the
deferment granted may not exceed seven months. In which case also we
wish that deferment from the first lecture may not be granted in favor of
the succeeding lecturer, but that he be held to observe the time ordered for
him by the President, as if there were no such deferment.&rsquo;</div>

London, 1684, pp. 34-37: &lsquo;Elizabeth by the grace of God, Queen of
England, France &amp; Ireland, defender of the faith &amp;c. Greetings to all
those reached by the present letter. Our father of noble memory Henry
VIII, formerly King of England, among certain other decrees for the
well-being and usefulness of his kingdom of England, especially watching
over the health of his subjects, through his Letters Patent instituted in
perpetuity a College of certain grave men of medicine who practised
medicine publicly in his City of London and its suburbs within seven
miles of that city. In the name of the President of the College and the
Fellowship of the faculty of medicine of London, he incorporated them in
the corporate and political body, and he granted to the same President and
College of Fellowship aforesaid and to its successors diverse liberties
and privileges. Our same father not only confirmed those Letters Patent and
all things contained in them through his <i>Senatus Consultum</i> or Parliament
held in the fourteenth and fifteenth years of his reign, but also he increased
and amplified the same statute in many ways. Since our said father
granted this pious design for the well-being of the commonwealth,
assuredly day by day there will be manifestly great advancement if to the
aforesaid President, College or Fellowship and their successors forever we
grant what is especially necessary for those professing medicine, certain
human bodies annually for dissection. Know that we, not only deservedly
renewing the famous institution of our said father, but also considering
the responsibility of our royal office to provide as much as possible for the
assured health and security of our subjects, of our special grace and from
our certain knowledge and genuine affection for our people, we grant
presently and for our heirs and successors to the aforesaid President of the
College or Fellowship of the aforesaid faculty of medicine of London,
and their successors or assigns, that they may have and receive annually
and forever in future times, at one time or at different times of the year, at
the discretion, desire and liberty of the aforesaid President during the time
of his existence and of his successors, one, two, three or four human bodies
for dissection and anatomization, which have been condemned and executed

<div class="fndef"><a class="fn" id="fni_43" href="#fri_43">[43]</a>Caius was not only a confirmed Galenist, but with the passing
years ever a more conservative and literal Galenist, and his anatomical
lectures to the surgeons were described by Bullein in his <i>Little Dialogue</i> of
1579 as &lsquo;reveiling ... the hidden jewels and precious treasures of Cl.
Galenus&rsquo;. It seems likely that, whatever anatomical lectures were given in
the College of Physicians, they must, at least for a time, have been of like
character. In the <i>Annals</i> of the college as written by Caius we find that as
late as the year 1559 a certain Joannes Geynes was subject to disciplinary
action because of his assertion that Galen had been guilty of error. He was
required to state that &lsquo;I Joannes Geynes confess that Galen did not err
in those things for which I criticized him&rsquo;, <i>Annales a Collegio Condito</i>,
pp. 53-54, in <i>The Works of John Caius</i>, ed. Venn, Cambridge, 1912.
Such conservatism carried over to the study of anatomy would certainly
have been detrimental to any advancement of knowledge.</div>

<div class="fndef"><a class="fn" id="fni_50" href="#fri_50">[50]</a>This portrait shows Banister giving the Visceral lecture at Barber-Surgeon&rsquo;s
Hall in 1581; of small size and painted by an unknown artist
on two pieces of paper joined down the middle, it is nevertheless sufficiently
detailed for us to discover that Banister is using the octavo edition of
Colombo&rsquo;s work printed in Paris in 1572. The portrait is now laid down
in an album of anatomical drawings, also painted for Banister, which was
formerly owned by William Hunter and is now preserved in the Hunterian
Museum, Glasgow. The drawings consist of views of the skeleton, the
superficial muscles, nerves and veins drawn in colour on a dark ground with
some skill. Singer, in his <i>Evolution of Anatomy</i>, London, 1925, p. 174, suggests
that the skeletal figures are probably the earliest prepared in England
which were actually drawn from the bones. This could well be true, but
Banister based his drawing of the nerves on a plate of Charles Estienne, 1545,
and his figures of the superficial muscles and veins are possibly based on Valverde.
Other relics of Banister can be seen at Cambridge. The University
Library has a book-like casket containing a small ivory skeleton and the
<i>&eacute;corch&eacute;</i> figure of a man given to the library by Banister in 1591. King&rsquo;s College
Library has a copy of <i>The Historie of Man</i> presented by the author in 1596.</div>
<div class="fndef"><a class="fn" id="fni_51" href="#fri_51">[51]</a>Books printed on the Continent were freely available in England,
and it could be argued that this was one reason why so few anatomical
texts were published in the Tudor period. It has already been noted that
Colombo&rsquo;s <i>De Re Anatomica</i> in the octavo edition of Paris, 1572, was
used by Banister in his visceral lecture. This could well have been the text
recommended to apprentices of Barber-Surgeon&rsquo;s Hall. Such imported
books were, of course, published in Latin and were therefore suitable to the
students of the College of Physicians and those of Oxford or of Cambridge.
It seems likely that the students at Barber-Surgeons&rsquo; Hall created a demand
for more simple texts in the vernacular and this is surely the reason for the
continued popularity of such books as Thomas Vicary&rsquo;s archaic text.</div>

<h3 id="c3"><i>To the Distinguished and Illustrious
<br />Henry, Earl of Surrey.</i>
<br /><i>David Edwardes, Physician, Sends Greetings</i></h3>
<p>How often, Henry, I have recalled the honourable
achievements of those noble dukes, in what
great honour all Englishmen held your grandfather
during his lifetime for his remarkable ability and
happy successes in warfare, as well as his extraordinary
prudence in the administration of civil affairs; and also at
present how expertly everything that pertains to us English
is daily managed by your famous father. I cannot sufficiently
admire your family, but not so much for those reasons as
because I see you established above what can be said for
many other young men in this age, and turning your mind
so seriously to those things which will render it better. I am
by no means certain whether I ought to ascribe this to the
benefit of that stock from which you have been brought
forth to us, whether to the gods who through you smile
upon and favour us English. However it may be, let us
hope what has occurred will be to the advantage of our
commonwealth, and that the more so since you have pursued
worth-while things for so long a time. Thus you will
approach the next age better prepared, and good habits will
meanwhile strengthen your mind so that later you will not
easily fall into worse. But the more you may be strengthened
by counsel and prudence, with confidence placed in your
family, so much the better guidance will Norfolk have when
you succeed as heir to your father&rsquo;s estates. Meanwhile how
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
much more useful you will be to your people as Earl of Surrey,
and finally so much the more will all Englishmen desire you
to undertake the affairs of the commonwealth. There is no
doubt that you can achieve all these things which will be to
the increase of your honours and to the honour of your family.</p>
<p>As your talent and gravity of character promise, so we
have great hope that you will be like your father and grandfather.
I wish you both the greatest successes and the most
fruitful increase of all the best things. And once more I wish
that this whole year from its beginning may be happy for you
and yours. With this augury I dedicate to you this our introduction
to anatomy. For as this part of the art of medicine
is not known to all, because it is something very difficult
to comprehend, it requires an easy arrangement by which
readers, as if led by the hand to it, may lean upon it. This is
indeed a slight work, but wholly useful for all physicians and
surgeons, because it explains many things briefly. It contains
nothing obscure, nothing elaborate, very readily accessible to
the talents of all those who are neither dull nor ill-adapted to
matters of knowledge. In this, if anything differs from the
common opinions of physicians, let no one be astonished
because the learned do not believe the same in these matters.</p>
<p>Hereafter, if God permit, I shall compose a complete
book of anatomy in which I shall further the opinions of
all the learned, to which my own opinion will be added.
I could have done this at present but not, however, with the
same effort or with the form of an introduction preserved. It
remains that this little book, which we have enlisted in
the service of the commonwealth, may be pleasing to you,
for it recognizes the existence of those very few unlearned
physicians by whose mistakes many perish, from which this
fact will be gathered, that no parts of the body should be
unknown to physicians. Farewell. Cambridge. 1 January.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">THE INTRODUCTION TO</span>
<br />ANATOMY OF
<br />DAVID EDWARDES
<br />ENGLISHMAN</h2>
<p>The whole lower venter&mdash;for thence it is necessary to
begin the dissection of the human body because that
part putrefies very readily&mdash;from the outer skin to the
peritoneum is called <span class="small">EPIGASTRION</span> by the Greeks and
<i>mirach</i><a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> by the Barbarians, of which the following are the
parts.</p>
<p>The superficial skin which covers the whole body is completely
insensitive. The skin lying and stretched under the
very thin and superficial skin is sensitive.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> The Greeks call
it <span class="small">HYPODERMA</span>. A kind of fat occupies the whole venter
and is spread under the sensitive skin except for the middle.</p>
<p>A sinewy and thin membrane immediately follows this.
A membrane taking origin from the muscles is subjoined
firmly to this where a straight line appears in the middle.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Two oblique descending muscles<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> lie under these toward
the lowest venter. The oblique ascending muscles<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
are placed under these. Two rectus muscles have a close
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
relationship. And lowest of all are the transverse muscles.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
Therefore there are these eight for which there are nearly
individual sinewy coverings by which they are distinguished
from one another.</p>
<p>An aponeurosis, or rather a thick and firm membrane, is
stretched under them which some falsely call the peritoneum.
So much for the epigastrium and its parts.</p>
<p>Certainly the peritoneum is a sinewy part, soft to the
touch, of ordinary firmness, occupying the whole venter,
and resting under the aponeurosis or membrane which I
mentioned. The Greeks gave that name to it. The Barbarians
call it <i>siphac</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>zirbus</i> or omentum is extended under the peritoneum.
The <i>zirbus</i> is a kind of fat derived from sinewy
threads and the slender adipose substance of the nerves; it is
less thick than the fat previously mentioned. It covers much
of the intestines and the lowest part of the stomach and
assists the coction of aliment.</p>
<p>The intestines take origin from the stomach; of them, that
which is called rectum and <i>longanon</i><a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> is the lowest of all the
intestines and contains the dry burden of the bowel, and
its head extends outward between the nates so that it may
dispose of its burden. The colon is continuous with it and
in its ascent goes around the left kidney, and at the sides of
the stomach it falls away to the right.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> What the Greeks
call <span class="small">TYPHLON</span> and <span class="small">MONOPHTHALMON</span>, the Romans
the blind intestine and one-eyed,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> is attached to the colon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
of which it is the only passage; for the other end is closed so
that it may assist coction more suitably in the manner of the
stomach. Hence the name for the thing. And such is the
number of the thicker intestines.</p>
<p>The caecum is continuous with the ileon,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> an intestine
twisted into numerous sinuses; from its shape the Greeks
gave it the name <span class="small">PARA TOU EILEISTHAI</span>, that is, from
its involvement; and its disease is called <i>iliacus</i>. The jejunum
follows it. Dissectors of bodies gave this name jejunum to
the latter intestine because of the fact that it is always found
empty and contains nothing. For the liver first snatches
away whatever the jejunum might contain. Above all these
intestines arises the duodenum which is continuous below
with the jejunum and above with the pylorus. It is called
<span class="small">D&#332;DEKA DAKTYLOM</span> by the Greeks from the measure
of twelve fingers. These three [intestines] by reason of their
substance are called the slender intestines.</p>
<p>The stomach is located under the diaphragm, of which
the upper mouth ends in the oesophagus, properly called
<i>stomachus</i>; the lower opening through which aliment is sent
into the intestines is called <span class="small">PYL&#332;ROS</span>.</p>
<p>The spleen is an organ of rare substance and lies at the
left side of the stomach; the liver being in the right hypochondrium.
The latter is rounded and to some degree
lunate, the former longish and somewhat quadrate. The
gibbous part<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> of each of these extends toward the lower
ribs, because there is a concavity in each of them which is
very close to the stomach. The liver gives rise to the blood.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>
The spleen purges it of black bile. The spleen increases
with loss to the rest of the body. The size of the liver is
useful to the whole bodily structure, because it provides
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
copious blood and natural spirit. The liver has lobes which
the Greeks call <span class="small">LOBOUS</span>, sometimes three, sometimes
more,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> and in its hollow extends the gall bladder by which
the blood is freed of bile and issues forth pure. It is especially
by exhalation and transpiration of this bladder that the
duodenum and jejunum are sometimes stained;<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> sometimes
they are irritated if there is a very large transpiration of particularly
corrosive bile.</p>
<p>From the hollow of the liver<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> arises the portal vein which
is formed from the concurrence of the many slender veins
of the liver. On the other hand, it divides again into innumerable
parts and gives off an immense multitude of
veins which afterward are inserted here and there into
almost all the intestines and to the little adipose membranes
mixed together, so that they provide nutritional substance
for the liver in the generation of blood. For chyle and food
are sent down from the stomach directly to the intestines;
the pylorus yields an exit as soon as the stomach has received
as much as suffices for its uses and has accomplished
its coction. Unless it be transmuted into the nature of blood
[this food] contributes very little toward the nourishment of
the rest of the body. Therefore these numerous venules serve
to draw out from the intestines the best juice of the nutriment
as yet not sufficiently concocted, and deliver it to the
hollow of the liver where the blood is made. Doubtless
those venules can be called meseraics, or by the Greek word
mesenterics. The Latins call them milk veins.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> For their
protection, lest in their numerous ramifications some of
them be torn apart or rent by a more vigorous motion of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
body, the <span class="small">PANKREAS</span>, that is, glandular flesh which is
sometimes called <span class="small">KALLIKREAS</span> by the Greeks, attaches
to the duodenum so that the venules may individually be
more firmly supported.</p>
<p>The blood passes from the hollow of the liver, in which it
was formed a little earlier, to the gibbosity<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> of the liver;
however, it is not the same kind as was made in the hollow
but more pure and simple, since both biles have been
strained from it and transmitted to their receptacles so that
the blood may be more unsullied for nourishing the body
wholesomely and for producing spirits. From the gibbosity
the blood is extended throughout the whole body through
the vena cava&mdash;called <span class="small">KOIL&#274;</span> by the Greeks&mdash;and by the
many branches of that vein. This vein surpasses all the rest
of the veins of the body in size and arises from the gibbosity
of the liver. Descending from this through the middle of
the spine, one [branch] on each side seeks the kidneys, each
branch extending a palm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>These branches of the vena cava are the emulgent veins.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
In the body of that one whom we dissected very recently the
left branch had a higher place of origin.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> Very often, however,
the opposite occurs, so that the right emulgent vein is
carried higher in the body. Nature employs these emulgent
veins for carrying down the watery part and bile of the
blood from the liver to the kidneys. A like number of little
branches of arteries in the same site, from the great aorta
artery going under the vena cava, run an equal length into
the kidneys under the emulgent veins, unburdening the heart
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
of bile and watery blood; these have the name of emulgent
arteries.</p>
<p>A vein and artery descend from the left emulgents into
the testis of the left side. They are the seminal passages
swollen with blood and spirit; the seminal matter contained
in them procreates females, because their humour is watery
and requires coction. Seminal passages, likewise an artery
and vein, are extended downward from the right [emulgents]
into the right testis; but having arisen from the
trunks of the vena cava and aorta artery, therefore the juice
in them is less watery, and properly concocted is more
suited for the generation of males. In these passages blood
is concocted, and afterward transferred to the glandular flesh
of the testes it acquires the form of semen.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The kidneys are solid and hard organs, not sentient, and
the attractive force in them is very powerful. They purge the
blood of its watery part and bile, but they retain [some of]
the blood so that they may be nourished by it and expel the
rest of the humour. For the <span class="small">OUR&#274;T&#274;RES</span> are attached to
them,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> that is, the urinary passages, whitish, reed-like and
tensile which it may be said extend to the bladder and are
similar to its substance.</p>
<p>The diaphragm is a membranous substance, running
between the vital and natural members. It is called
<span class="small">DIAPHRAGMA</span> by the Greeks. It strengthens the expulsive
force in the intestines, it is assigned to the members selected
for spirit, and it curbs the smoky vapours lest they blacken
the vigorous spirits of the heart and brain. Above, there is
affixed to it a sinewy covering<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> which clothes the thorax
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
inwardly and binds the pectoral ribs to the interstitial
spaces, which covering the Greeks in good part name
<span class="small">PLEURA</span>, but sometimes it is called <span class="small">HYPOZ&#332;MA</span><a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> by
them. By its inflammation pleurisy occurs, the name taken
from the covering.</p>
<p>From the pleura near the spine arises a membrane separating
the lungs and lower thorax into equal parts through
the middle. It is commonly called the mediastinum, and is
so well adapted to the lungs that a defect of one lung is not
easily communicated to the other.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> Certainly the lungs inhabit
the middle palace of the chest, invigorate the spirits
of the heart and brain, temper the heat and avert the danger
of suffocation, and have lobes like the liver. They hold the
heart constantly in a kind of embrace in the manner of very
caressing nurses and sing a harmony of qualities by which
they soothe the individual parts of the body and make them
vigorous. From that part of the mediastinum which holds
the middle of the lungs, a thick and hard membrane
appears which completely covers the heart,<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> called in Greek
<span class="small">PERIKARDION</span>. This protects the heart lest it be afflicted
by accidental things; and lest it lack the moistening fomentation
by which its heat is moderated. It unites the forces of
the heart and prevents the exhaled spirits from being dispersed
by vehement motion. Here the heart establishes itself,
prince of members<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> and an organ sharpened into [the
shape of] a top; hollow within; continuously palpitating
by its three ventricles,<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> with an auricle on each side in
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
which life remains the longest.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> The seat of the spirit and
a small amount of blood is in the left ventricle of the heart,
from which the pulmonary vein advances and enters the
lungs to receive better-prepared air from them;<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> this it introduces
into the ventricles of the heart lest they become
unduly heated. The right ventricle contains more and very
hot blood. The vena cava rises into this<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> through the middle
of the spine and pours in the tinder of the vital spirit from
the liver. From this the pulmonary artery belches much
blood into the lungs. In the ventricle between the right
and left there is tempered blood of slight quantity. From
this ventricle the large artery called the aorta arises, the
vehicle of the vital spirits; it is constantly agitated up and
down by the contrary motions of dilatation and constriction,
and finally it is divided into myriads of branches so that it
revivifies the living parts in the whole body by a gentle
flatus. This is the end of the account of the vital members.</p>
<p>The membrane covering the bony roundness of the head
outwardly is called <span class="small">PERIKRANION</span> by the Greeks, and it
is hard, thick and firm, and conforms in substance to the
exterior covering of the brain which is commonly called
the dura mater. The covering of the dura mater hangs
affixed to the pericranium, so it seemed to nature, lest in
contact it have an effect on the brain; under this covering
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
a thin and soft membrane, which is called the pia mater,
sprinkled with numerous veins, envelops and nourishes
the brain. It is continuous to the dura mater and the substance
of the brain, and it penetrates the ventricles of the
brain. Hence the brain displays itself very clearly to the eyes,
both its ventricles and the cerebellum placed at the rear of
the head from which the medulla descends into the vertebrae
of the spine. Here the reticular plexus (commonly
called the <i>rete mirabile</i>), woven together from numerous
slender threads of veins and arteries at the summit of the
cerebellum, displays its <i>phantasia</i>; in it the vital spirit carried
upward from the heart through the arteries, having been
fully concocted and rarefied, becomes animal spirit, the
cause of sensation and motion in the whole body. For
the brain is the source of the nerves, but the nerves are the
vessels which distribute animal spirit;<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> from the medulla of
the spine (it is called <i>nucha</i> by the Barbarians) they are distributed
to all parts of the body. Furthermore, there extend
from the brain seven pairs of nerves.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> Two nerves look forward
to the nares,<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> the olfactory organs. Two are carried to
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the eyes,<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> intersecting in their course, from whence comes
the faculty of vision. Another two [carry] motion to the
eyes,<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> another two give motion and taste to the tongue.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a>
From two the stomach acquires sensation<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> so that appetite
may not be lacking to it, and from as many slender nerves the
palate distinguishes flavours.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> Finally, from a single origin
one nerve is extended on each side, provided for the right
and for the left ear lest they be struck by deafness.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> These
things which have been said by me briefly regarding the
animal members, within the proposed limits, end this introduction
to anatomy. Other matters which pertain to this
subject I shall discuss in another work where we shall adapt
the discourse to all aspects of anatomy.</p>

refers to the abdominal wall as venter. Lower venter proper means the abdomen
or abdominal cavity together with the pelvis.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>There is confusion here for, of course, the skin of the body is most sensitive.
The subcutaneous tissues, on the other hand, are relatively insensitive.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a>The caecum was termed the <i>monoculus</i> by medieval anatomists. There is no
mention of the appendix; this was first described in 1523 by Berengario da
Carpi.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>The ileum.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a>The curved surface.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>Galen maintained that the major veins had their origin in the liver.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>Multiple lobes to the liver was another teaching of Galen derived from
comparative anatomy.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_14" href="#fr_14">[14]</a>Post-mortem staining of the viscera with bile is very common.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_15" href="#fr_15">[15]</a>The porta hepatis.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a>This is a good account of the function of the lymphatic vessels.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_17" href="#fr_17">[17]</a>The gibbosity of the liver is its curved, upper surface.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_18" href="#fr_18">[18]</a>The emulgent veins are the renal veins.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_19" href="#fr_19">[19]</a>This is normal in man but in some animals the right renal vessels arise
higher than the left. It will be noted that he speaks from his own experience. It is
a pity that he qualifies this statement in the next sentence with a reference to the
then current teaching, derived from Galen.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_20" href="#fr_20">[20]</a>The fallacious idea of the testis filtering off the sperm from the blood brought
down to it by the testicular artery lasted a long time. Note too the old fallacy of
the left testis producing a female foetus and the right producing a male.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_21" href="#fr_21">[21]</a>The ureters.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_22" href="#fr_22">[22]</a>The pleura.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_23" href="#fr_23">[23]</a>Either Edwardes or the printer was at fault in the form of the Greek script,
while the word has more the meaning of diaphragm than of pleura.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_24" href="#fr_24">[24]</a>Edwardes is obviously aware of the individuality of each pleural sac.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_25" href="#fr_25">[25]</a>The pericardium.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_26" href="#fr_26">[26]</a>Note that the heart is the most important organ of the body.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_27" href="#fr_27">[27]</a>The three-ventricled heart was a myth which remained entrenched in
anatomy until Niccol&ograve; Massa (1536) and Vesalius. Leonardo da Vinci showed
that there were only two ventricles but his drawings were not seen by his contemporaries.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_28" href="#fr_28">[28]</a>Edwardes is to a degree correct when he says that life remains longest in the
auricles. Slow contraction of the auricles can be seen for a short time after contraction
of the ventricles has ceased. This passage could suggest that he practised
vivisection.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_29" href="#fr_29">[29]</a>Note the persistence of the old idea that the left ventricle contains air.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_30" href="#fr_30">[30]</a>The medieval anatomists regarded the right and left atria as part of the
corresponding ventricle, hence they stated that the venae cavae opened into the
right ventricle. Edwardes&rsquo;s acceptance of the old theory is interesting for just
above this in the text he mentions the auricles as separate chambers.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_31" href="#fr_31">[31]</a>Galen taught that the nerves were hollow and carried the animal spirit from
the brain to the periphery. The vital spirit (air) was carried by the arteries to the
brain where, in the <i>rete mirabile</i> it was transformed into the animal spirit.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_32" href="#fr_32">[32]</a>The ancient idea that there were seven pairs of nerves did not disappear
from anatomical teaching until Thomas Willis in 1664 increased the number to
nine and Samuel Thomas Soemmerring in 1778 established the modern order
of numbering the nerves into twelve pairs. In the account which follows
Edwardes does not follow the ancient description of the cranial nerves. According
to Galen, and indeed Vesalius, the olfactory nerves were not regarded as
separate entities; moreover the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves
were part of a single nerve. Edwardes does not describe the trigeminal or facial
nerves nor the trochlear or abducent. The trochlear nerve had been described by
Alessandro Achillini in 1520. The abducent nerve was to be described later by
Eustachius.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_33" href="#fr_33">[33]</a>Olfactory nerves. That Edwardes regarded them as functional units is
worthy of note.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_34" href="#fr_34">[34]</a>Optic nerves (the ancient first pair).
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_35" href="#fr_35">[35]</a>Oculomotor nerves (the ancient second pair).

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
